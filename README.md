# Cpp_Tetris
A Tetris game engine using C++

To make this I followed "One Lone Coder's" Tetris Game Engine in C++,
along with adding my own pizzaz such as including an exit prompt (instead of using system(pause) ), and properly formating all logical loops
and statements within their scope.

The next thing I want to work on in this project is having the program create a sound when a line is created 
to enhance user experience, but for now, I am happy with my results. Its quite fun.
